# Lockdown model

Quick model to estimate likely lockdown time in days over a year.

Key parameters:

- Daily chance of lockdown: the odds of a new breakout on any particular day. 
- Snap lockdown time: number of days in lockdown when breakout detected.
- Chance of extension: The odds that any breakout won't be under control at the end of a lockdown period and will be extended for a week.
